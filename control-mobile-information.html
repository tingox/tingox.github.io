    <p>Currently the user of a smartphone have very little control over what data he or she shares, and who gets access to data data. The best option today is to assume that everyone who has asked for access to any of your data, has, in fact, acces to /all/ of your data, and shares it with third parties unknown to you. Bleak, but with the lack of transparency in current mobile ecosystems this is what the situation looks like for a user.</p>
<p>In the future things might be better. Experienced Android users probably know about <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> which gives you a free and open-source Android operating system. You are still dependent on the same services, but at least some control of the operating system itself. Another project is <a href="https://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a> which aims to create a Linux distribution that will allow you to use a device for at least ten years. Just in alpha, and probably many years away from their goal, but still interesting. Then there is <a href="https://e.foundation/">/e/</a>. Not only do they have privacy as a goal, but in addition to making a privacy-focused operating system for mobiles (taking advantage of LineageOS), but they also build services that you need for your mobile phone and the apps you run on it. Currently, the number of mobile devices supported isn't very large (91 at the time of writing this), but they have a working mobile ecosystem that is pro privacy. Very nice.</p>
